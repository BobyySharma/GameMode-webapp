Got it — you're on a 1-day sprint. That means we go MVP-only: build fast, keep it clean, and focus on working core features. Here's a hyper-focused 1-day action plan to get your GameMode productivity RPG app done today.

🏃‍♂️ 1-Day GameMode MVP Plan
🔹 1. Set Up Project (1 hour)
flutter create gamemode

Add dependencies:

yaml
Copy
Edit
firebase_core
firebase_auth
cloud_firestore
provider
Initialize Firebase (use Firebase CLI, enable Auth & Firestore)

🔹 2. Build Key Screens (3–4 hours)
🔸 Home/Dashboard Page:
Show:

XP bar (just a progress bar)

Current level

Today’s tasks list (with checkboxes)

Buttons:

“+ Add Task”

“Start Focus Mode”

🔸 Add Task Page:
Fields:

Task title

XP reward

Due date (or just “Today” for MVP)

🔸 Focus Mode Page:
25 min Pomodoro Timer (use Timer.periodic)

Show task selected

On complete: give XP → update user level

🔹 3. Backend Logic (2–3 hours)
🔸 Data Models:
User:

dart
Copy
Edit
{
  "username": "Ash",
  "xp": 120,
  "level": 2,
  "streak": 3
}
Task:

dart
Copy
Edit
{
  "title": "Read docs",
  "completed": false,
  "xp": 20,
  "date": "2025-05-07"
}
🔸 Leveling Logic:
dart
Copy
Edit
int xpForLevel(int level) => level * 100;
🔸 Completing a Task:
Mark task complete

Add XP to user

Check if level up

Update Firestore

🔹 4. Polish + Submit (2–3 hours)
Minimal UI polish:

Use LinearProgressIndicator for XP

Icons from Icons.check, Icons.add, etc.

Use default Flutter theme for now

Record Demo:

Use screen recorder (Android or emulator)

Narrate your clicks or add captions

Keep it under 2–3 mins
